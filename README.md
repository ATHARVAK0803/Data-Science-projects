## Introduction

This repository is designed as a comprehensive guide to implement and experiment with data science concepts. Whether you're new to the field or looking to enhance your skills, these projects will help you explore:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building and evaluating predictive models
- Applying domain knowledge for meaningful insights

## Projects Overview

### 1. Iris Flower Classification 
- **Objective:** Classify iris flowers into three species (_setosa_, _versicolor_, and _virginica_) based on sepal and petal dimensions.
- **Dataset:** [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction 
- **Objective:** Predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on their demographic and socio-economic features.
- **Dataset:** [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) (Kaggle)
- **Model Used:** Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and more.

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection 
- **Objective:** Identify fraudulent credit card transactions from a given dataset.
- **Dataset:** [Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) (Kaggle)
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks.
