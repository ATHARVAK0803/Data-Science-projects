## Introduction

This repository is designed for anyone looking to explore practical data science projects. These projects cover:  

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Building and evaluating predictive models  
- Applying domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights  

These projects demonstrate the essential skills required for a **Data Science fresher role**.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Iris Flower Classification
- **Objective:** Classify iris flowers into three species (_setosa_, _versicolor_, and _virginica_) based on sepal and petal dimensions.  
- **Dataset:** [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) (UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest  

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on demographic and socio-economic features.  
- **Dataset:** [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) (Kaggle)  
- **Models Used:** Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and more  

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Objective:** Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.  
- **Dataset:** [Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) (Kaggle)  
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks
